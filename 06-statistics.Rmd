## Sample Data
This chapter uses the sample data generate with below code. The idea is to simulate two categorical-alike feature, and two numeric value feature:  

- **dept** is random character between 'D1', 'D2', 'D3', 'D4' and 'D5'  
- **grp** is random character with randomly generated 'G1', 'G2'  
- **value1** represents numeric value, normally distributed at mean 50  
- **value2** is numeric value, normally distributed at mean 25  

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
my.df = data.frame(
  dept = paste('D',sample(1:5, 100, replace = T),sep=''),
  grp  = paste('G',sample(1:2, 100, replace = T),sep=''),
  value1 = rnorm(1:100, mean = 50, sd = 5),
  value2 = rnorm(1:100, mean = 20, sd = 3),
  stringsAsFactors = F
)
my.df$dept = as.factor(my.df$dept)
my.df$grp = as.factor(my.df$grp)
head(my.df)
```
