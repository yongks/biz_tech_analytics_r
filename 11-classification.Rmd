## Performance Measurement

There are many performance measurement used for binary classification.  Here are the rules of thumb which one to use:  

- **Recall**: If you don't mind getting some inaccurate result, as long as you get as much correct ones 
- **Precision**: If you demand rate of correctness and willing to reject some correct results  
- **F1 Score**: For a more balanced measurement, taking into consideraton both recall and precision  

### Confusion Matrix

![Confusion Matrix and Performance Measurement](./images/confusion_table.jpg)

#### Accuracy

- Accuracy answers the question: **From the total samples, how many had been correctly predicted by the model ?**  
- $Accuracy = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}$
- This measurement is useful when the both **classes are balanced** (that is, the number of TP and TN cases are almost balanced)  
- In practice, it seems that the best accuracy is usually achieved when the cutpoint is **near the Probability(actual TRUE)**  
- Accuracy is completely usessless in highly skewed class.  For example, with a disease that only affects 1 in a million people a completely bogus screening test that always reports “negative” will be 99.9999% accurate  

#### Recall

- Recall answers the question: **Out of all actual positive samples, how many were correctly predicted by classifiers ?**  
- $Recall = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}$

#### Precision

- Precison answers the question:  **Out of all the samples classifier predicted as positive, what fraction were correct ?**  
- $Precision = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}$

#### F1 Score

- F1 score is the **harmonic mean of Precision and Recall**. Intuitively, F1 Score is the **weighted average of Precision and Recall**. It takes into account all three measures: TP, FP and FN  
- $Precision = 2*\frac{Recall * Precision}{Recall + Precision}$  
- F1 is usually more useful than accuracy, especially if you have an unbalanced class distribution  
  
#### Area Under ROC (AUROC)

- ROC curve is basically a graph of **TPR vs FPR** (some refer to as Recall vs (1-Sensitivity), plotted for **different thresholds**  
- Comparing two different models, the model with **higher AUROC is considered to have higher overall Accuracy**  
- AUROC (Area Under ROC) measures :  
    - AUC of **0.5**: means the model is as good as tossing a coin, worthless  
    - AUC of **1.0**: means for all cutoff points, TPR=1 and FPR=0. Intuitively it means, all samples had been correctly classified into TP (TPR=1) and TN(FPR=0), and there is no FP and FN. Ultiamtely it means Accuracy is 100%

### Cutoff Threshold Optimization

#### Understanding Cutoff Impacts

Cutoff threshold **direclty influence** the value of TP, FP, TN, FN.  
If **cutoff threshold is lowered** (lower probability to classify as Postive), the results are:  

- **More linient** and hence **more samples will be classified as Positive**  
- More predicted Positives means more TP and FP, hence **TPR and FPR increases**  
- However, **TPR and FPR increases at different rate**:  
    - If TPR increases faster than FPR -> this is **good**, as the lowered threshold generated more TP than FP  
    - If FPR increases faster then TPR -> this is **not good**, as the lowered threhsold generated more FP than TP  
- The cutoff with highest TPR/FPR value is the optimal  means optimum point whereby It is possible to discover the optimum cutoff by finding the cutoff with highest TPR/FPR

Different threshold produces different performance metrics (Accuracy, Recall, Precision and Specificity and F1-score). As an example, picture below shows how threshold influences the ROC curve.  

![Threshold and ROC](./images/roc_threshold_demo.gif)  

The only way to estimate the **optimum threshold** for each of the performance measurement will be to measure them for a **wide range of threshold**.  

#### Cutoff Impact Visualization

Selecting a cutoff threshold depends on the objectives of the researcher. To help understanding the how cutoff changes the performance metircs, try **visualize** them in below graph:  

1.Threshold vs Accuracy  
2.Threshold vs Recall (TPR)  
3.Threshold vs TPR/FPR  
4.Threshold vs Precision  
5.Threshold vs F1 Score  
6.ROC Curve (TPR vs FPR)  


### Model Evaluation

#### Compare With Baseline

In an highly unbalanced dataset (eg. patients that is diagnosed with cancer skewed towards negative).  Hence, it is essential to make a **lazy baseline comparison** with simply classifying every records with negative (cutoff at 1) or positive (cutoff at 0).  

Put in mind of the dataset used for comparison:  

- Use data from training set as model baseline, when concerning training performance  
- Use dta from test set as model baseline, when concerning test performance  

**Model Accuracy is not better than 'lazy' baseline !**  

- In highly bias class, in term of accuracy, the model usually unable to outperform the baseline by good marign  
- Hence **accuracy** is not a good measurement in such case    
- Model is still useful if the research objective is towards other measurement usch as **recall, precision**  
- Adjust the threshold to achieve optimum better objectives  

#### Combination of Variables

Model AIC to measure the usefullness. It is like R-square in linear regression.  Use it to compare model with different combinations of variables. 

Since logistic regression is a actual **linear regression of ln(odds)**, **multicolinearity** rule apply.

## Logistic Regression

### The Concept

Logistic Regression is a actually a **classification** algorithm. It is used to predict: 

- Binary outcome (1=Yes/Sucess, 0=No/Failure), given a set of independent variables. 
- Multinomial outcome (more than two categories) - however, reference category for comparison must be specified, otehrwise, must run multiple regressions with different refence categories  

Logistic Regression as a **special case** of linear regression where:  

- The outcome variable is categorical   
- **Ln of odds** as dependent variable  

Linear regression cannot be used for classification because:  

- Binary data does not have a normal distribution, which is a condition for many types of regressions  
- Predicted values can go beyond 0 and 1, which violates the definition of probability  
- Probabilities are often not linear  

### Assumptions

Since logistic regression is related to linear combination of IVs, it share some common asssumptions regarding IVs and error terms:  

1. Dependent variable must be 1/0 type eg. 'sucess/failure', 'male/female', 'yes/no'. Must not be ordinal and continous  
2. Observations must be independent  
3. Like OLS, Linearity between logit with all independent variables  
4. Like OLS, NO multicollinearity - if found, create interaction term, or drop one of the IVs  
5. Like OLS, error terms are assumed uncorrelated  

Although **logit**  is a linear relation with independent variables, logistic regression (which use MLE) is **different from OLS** Linear Regression as below, due to the fact that DV is categorical and not continuuous:  

- Can handle categorical independent variables  
- Does not assume normality of DV and IVs: becauae $p$ follow Bernoulli distribution  
- Does not assume linearity between DV and IVs: because DV is categorical  
- Does not assume homoscedasticity  
- Does not assume normal errors  

### Equations

- The goal of logistic regression is to estimate $p$ (the probability of 'Success') for a **linear combination** of the independent variables  
- This is done by 'linking' the linear combination of independent variables to Bernoulli probability distribution (with domain from 0 to 1), to predict the probability of success  

- The **link function** is called **logit**, which is the natural log of odds ratio. It is a linear function against independent variables:  
$logit(p) = ln(odds) = ln\bigg(\frac{p}{1-p}\bigg) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_n x_n$  

- Derive **Odd ratio** by anti-log. It measures the 'strength' of IV in affecting the outcome, p:  
$odds = \frac{p}{1-p} = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_n x_n}$  

- $p$ can be further derived as below sigmoid function. $p$ is **non-linear** against independent varibales :  
$p = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + ... +  \beta_nx_n}}$  

- The logistic graph below shows P(Y=1) vs $\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_n x_n$. **Intuitively, larger coefficients and independence varibles values increases the chance of being classified as Y=1*8  

- Compare the graph below to understand why logistic regression is better than linear regression in binary classification

#### High School Log Formula

Some of the high scholl maths are useful for calculating the logistic scores. Remember them by heart.  

- **What is ls log**  
$y = 10^a$  
$log(y) = a$  

$y = e^a$  
$ln(y) = a$  

- Ln is log **base e**  
$ln(a) = log_e(a)$  

- Basic **properties** of log  
$ln(1) = log(1) = 0$  
$ln(0) = log(0) = Inf$  

- Log of **division** becomes substration of log  
$ln\bigg(\frac{a}{b}\bigg) = ln(a) - ln(b)$ 
  
- Exponential of **summation** becomes multiplication of exponential   
$e^{a+b} = e^a * e^b$  

### Sample Data
