# Model Optimization

## Occamâ€™s Razor 

- Given two models of similar generalization errors,  one should prefer the simpler model over the more complex model  
- For complex models, there is a greater chance that it was fitted accidentally by errors in data  
- Therefore, one should include model complexity when evaluating a model
