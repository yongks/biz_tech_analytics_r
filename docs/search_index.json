The objective of linear regression modeling is to find the most optimum equation that best explain the data Optimum equation is defined as the one that has the least cost (error) Once we can derived the optimum equation, we can use the model to predict target \\(Y&#39;\\) base on new variables \\(X_1,X_2,X_3~etc\\). 10.4.1.1 Equation \\[ \\begin{align} Y~&amp;~=~a~+~b~ \\cdot X~+~e \\\\ \\text{where:}&amp;\\\\ Y &amp;= \\text{dependant variable (target)}\\\\ X &amp;= \\text{independant variable(s) (predictor(s))}:~ X_1, X_2, X_3~etc\\\\ a &amp;= \\text{intercept}\\\\ \\beta &amp;= \\text{slope, or coefficient(s)}:~\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3~etc\\\\ \\end{align} \\] This equation can be used to predict the value of target variable based on given predictor $ equation $ variable(s). -->"]
